1.	Create tables with all constraints
2.	create views on any two tables using conditions
3.	create an index called EmployeeInd for the department table. Entries should be in ascending order by department id and then by employee id within each department.
4.	create sequence on Employee id
create database chit1;  use chit1; create table employee(   emp_id int primary key not null,   emp_name varchar(40),
  emp_age int not null);
 insert into employee values(
  1001,"brim",30);
 Insert into employee value(1002,"fade",24);
 Insert into employee value(1003,"yoru",26);  Insert into employee value(1004,"sova",41);
 Create view view_1 as
  Select emp_id,emp_name   From    employee
  whereemp_id=1001&emp_name='brim';
 create table department(   dept_id  int primary key not null,   dept_name varchar(20) not null,   dept_floor int not null);
