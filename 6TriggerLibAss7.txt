Write a database trigger on the Library table. The System should keep track of the 
records that are being updated or deleted. The old value of updated or deleted 	
records should be added in the Library_Audit table.		

create database lib; 
use lib;
create table library(accession integer primary key, title varchar(60),author varchar(80),publisher varchar(50));
create table library_audit(accession integer, title varchar(60),author varchar(80),publisher varchar(50),operation varchar(50),constraint ad foreign key(accession)references library(accession)); 
describe library; 
describe library_audit; 
insert into library values(1,'Let us C','kanitakar','Tata'); 
insert into library values(2,'C programming','balagi','technical'); 
insert into library values(3,'Distributed Systems','AAA','TecMax');
create trigger update_lib before update on library for each row insert into library_audit(accession,title,author,publisher,operation)values(old.accession,old.title,old.auth or,old.publisher,'update');
create trigger delete_lib before delete on library for each row insert into library_audit(accession,title,author,publisher,operation)values(old.accession,old.title,old.auth or,old.publisher,'delete');
SET foreign_key_checks=0;
select * from library; 
select * from library_audit; 
update library set publisher='tata' where accession=2; 
delete from library where accession=1;
select * from library_audit;
